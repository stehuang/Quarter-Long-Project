### 02/07/19, Week 5 Thursday
Went to my TA's office hours on Thursday to come up with ideas;

We discussed about 2 types of games:

1. static games 
    + games that do not require frequent updates on the display; board games like checkers/chess fall into this category.
    + advantage: can write logic first, print to console, then implement graphics
2. dynamic games
    + games that require one to frequently update the display
    + will have to implement graphics and code simultaneously

### 02/08/19, Week 5 Friday
Went to Prof Salazar's office hours today

* I have decided to implement Flappy Bird in C++
* The logic will not be difficult, but it'll require me to develop graphics at the same time
* This will require documenting my progress, implementing new features, and what I've learned
