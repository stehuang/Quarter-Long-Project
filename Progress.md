### 02/07/19, Week 5 Thursday
Went to my TA's office hours on Thursday to come up with ideas;

We discussed about 2 types of games:

1. static games 
    + games that do not require frequent updates on the display; board games like checkers/chess fall into this category.
    + advantage: can write logic first, print to console, then implement graphics
2. dynamic games
    + games that require one to frequently update the display
    + will have to implement graphics and code simultaneously

### 02/08/19, Week 5 Friday
Went to Prof Salazar's office hours today

* I have decided to implement Flappy Bird in C++
* The logic will not be difficult, but it'll require me to develop graphics at the same time
* This will require documenting my progress, implementing new features, and what I've learned


### 02/09/19, Week 5 Saturday
* Created "Bird.h" that creates the bird
    + created a simple declaration of the class (few functions & private members)
* I have a Game.cpp/Game.h file created too but it has yet been uploaded


### 02/14/19, Week 6 Thursday
Went to Andrew(TA)'s office hours today

* Learned that it is best to develop in Qt Creator than in Xcode then link the files
* Can structure the code in two ways
	+ logical/ui classes: separate commands from graphic displays in files, but link with functions/features
	+ incorporate graphics displays (i.e. Qt objects) in class definitions
ALSO
* I am using this [Snake Game](https://github.com/MeLikeyCode/SnakeGameMovementElongationDemo) tutorial/code on github as a reference for building the game and connecting files
